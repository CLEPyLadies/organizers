# ðŸš€ User manual for me

- This is inspired by the work of [Cassie Robinson](https://medium.com/@cassierobinson/a-user-manual-for-me-d3a851fbc694)
(found through the [global PyLadies project-communication team](https://github.com/pyladies/project-communications/tree/06804f0cbcd6380bbda0b1662ad260ab82e8b971/user-manual-for-me))
and is a great way for us to get to know each other and also learn more about how to work together in the best way possible.
- Using the template below, please create your own User Manual and add the link in the table below.
