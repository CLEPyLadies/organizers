Self-directed.


### The best way I receive feedback *

- Please tell me sooner rather than later if you are upset.
- Please do your best to try to suggest solutions/compromises.
- Email is easiest for me to process in my own time, in-person is easiest for us to see each others' emotions in real-time. Both work, depending on the topic.

### Times / hours I'd like to work on organizing Cleveland PyLadies *

I am generally the most productive in the morning before work, but I also have ADHD and like to work on tasks *right now* when I can't get my mind off of them. This is why I prefer self-directed work environments, as I can knuckle down on the tasks that I can't stop thinking about in that moment.
